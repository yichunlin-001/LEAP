Note for deployment:

- This environment includes GPU-accelerated packages such as `torch`, `cupy`, and `tigre`.
- CUDA version on the simulation computer must be confirmed prior to final installation.
- Recommended installation commands for GPU packages:

    pip install cupy-cuda117         # or 118, based on driver
    pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
    pip install git+https://github.com/CERN/TIGRE.git   # or install via conda if CUDA matches

- GUI packages like `napari`, `PyQt5`, `pyopengl` require a display environment or X11 forwarding.
